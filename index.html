               <div>
               <p>
                Born and raised in Miami,Fl, I have always been attracted to the entertainment world. 
                My passion and love for music started at the age of 4. 
                I remember my mother playing Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder on her 12" vinyl record player.
                I loved the rhythm and instruments used during that time.
                I listened to music every day until I got older and was able to afford a keyboard.
                I started making my own music, although that alone did not satify me. I wanted people to not just hear my music,
                but to visually see and experience it to really create a memory they would remember forever.

            <h2>Introduction to Lighting</h2>
            <p>
                <div>
                I was offered the opportunity to follow my dream, and I took it! I was given the chance to
                work with technology in the entertainment industry. The same way I learned to make music, I 
                taught myself to fix and program lights to music.

            <h2>Light Shows</h2>
            <p>
                <div>
                I have been blessed to help light up some of the worlds most talented artist. From Maroon 5, to Taylor
                Swift, P!nk, and Twenty One Pilots. My favorite by far has been Bruno Mars. Bruno's stage design and performance are
                incredible.

            <h2>Light shows without music</h2>
            <p>
                <div>
             Working with lights has also giving me the opportunity to work on projects that dont involve music but still speak to you through lights.
             I have worked on corporate business events, product tradeshows, new car unveilings, and
             various MMA fight night competitions.

            <p>
                <div>
                The club scene allowed me to venture out of the normal way of programming light shows.
                With a variety of DJ's every night, I challenge myself to bring a different light show
                every night. Some DJ's prefer some colors over others, and some just like to see new visuals and creativity from me.

            <p>
                <div>
            To sum it all up, <strong>I love lights!</strong> I love to program them,fix them, and just watch it all in action when it comes together.
            The most amazing part of this lighitng journey for me is being able to experiment and create ways for a new design.
